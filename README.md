## (yet another) End-to-end Typesafe APIs for Express

_\* Proof of Concept_

Achieves the same goal as [tRPC](https://github.com/trpc/trpc), but without inventing new syntax for writing servers. \
**Just use plain-old Express!**

- Zero run-time overhead
- Zero configuration
- Opt-in
- Compatiple with JSDoc

Made possible with TS template literal types, [_see here_](https://github.com/ghoullier/awesome-template-literal-types).
